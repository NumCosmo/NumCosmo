 * @short_description: Abstract class for linear matter power spectrum implementation.
 * @stability: Stable
 * @include: numcosmo/nc_powspec_ml.h
 *
 * This module comprises the set of functions to compute the linear matter power spectrum and
 * derived quantities.
 *
 * Following the description presented in #NcmPowspec, in this case we have that the field $\delta(\vec{x})$
 * represents the matter density fluctuations, i.e.,
 * $$\delta(\vec{x}) = \frac{\rho(\vec{x}) - \bar{\rho}}{\bar{\rho}},$$
 * where $\rho$ is the cold matter density field and $\bar{\rho}$ its mean.
