# NumCosmo: The Numerical Cosmology Library

Welcome to NumCosmo, a comprehensive toolkit designed to meet the diverse needs of modern cosmological research. Built with precision, efficiency, and modularity at its core, NumCosmo allows researchers to explore modern cosmology problems through a robust and versatile computational framework.

## Core Objectives

NumCosmo was developed with three foundational objectives:

### 1. Efficiency and Accessibility

At the heart of NumCosmo lies a commitment to performance and ease of use. Implemented in C, the library leverages the GObject system, which allows for automatic language bindings. This powerful feature means that classes implemented in C can be directly accessed and manipulated from higher-level languages like Python. Users can subclass, extend, and interface with NumCosmo components without writing extensive glue code, combining the speed of C with the accessibility of Python.

This design choice ensures that researchers can rapidly prototype, test, and iterate on their models without sacrificing computational efficiency, making NumCosmo both a high-performance and user-friendly tool.

### 2. Modularity and Flexibility

NumCosmo’s architecture is designed around modularity, with each component structured around clear and well-defined interfaces. This modularity allows for seamless integration and interchangeability of components, enabling researchers to implement different cosmological models, physical assumptions, or computational techniques without altering the core framework.

Each model and class within NumCosmo is developed with flexibility in mind, allowing for a broad range of applications, from simple cosmological calculations to complex simulations involving multiple interconnected components. The modular design also facilitates collaboration, as researchers can easily contribute new models or improvements that integrate smoothly with existing tools.

### 3. Integrated Statistical Framework

Recognizing the central role of statistical analysis in cosmology, NumCosmo includes a sophisticated and integrated statistical framework from the outset. The library features a special class of components known as models, which can be parameterized and directly linked to NumCosmo’s statistical tools. This integration allows researchers to configure and manipulate these models effortlessly, streamlining the process of performing statistical analyses.

NumCosmo’s statistical framework supports a wide array of analysis techniques, including:

- **Best-Fit Analysis**: Determining the set of model parameters that best fit the observational data.
- **Fisher Matrix Analysis**: Estimating the precision of parameter measurements and assessing the sensitivity of experiments.
- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**: Exploring the parameter space using various MCMC algorithms to generate samples from the posterior distribution.
- **Ensemble Sampler MCMC (ESMCMC)**: An advanced sampling technique designed to efficiently explore complex posterior distributions.
- **Approximate Posterior Ensemble Sampler (APES)**: A unique sampler developed within NumCosmo that uses approximations of the posterior to propose the next sample point, proven to be highly efficient for challenging posteriors. Benchmark comparisons, accessible from the documentation, demonstrate APES’s superior performance against other samplers.
- **MCMC Diagnostics**: Tools for assessing the convergence and efficiency of MCMC simulations.
- **Likelihood Ratio Tests**: Statistical tests for comparing the goodness-of-fit of different models.

Furthermore, NumCosmo’s framework is fully parallelized using both MPI (Message Passing Interface) and OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing), providing exceptional scalability and flexibility for large-scale computations.
