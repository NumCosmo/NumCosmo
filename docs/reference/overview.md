# NumCosmo API Overview

Welcome to the NumCosmo API documentation. This page provides an overview of the
library's structure, focusing on its two main namespaces:

NumCosmo is organized into two main namespaces:

1. **NumCosmoMath**: [API Reference](../numcosmo-math/index.html)
    - Contains **math-based** functions and code that are independent of cosmology,
      including general mathematical operations and optimizations.

2. **NumCosmo**: [API Reference](../numcosmo/index.html)
    - Focuses on **cosmology-related** functions and models, designed for cosmological
      computations and data analysis.
