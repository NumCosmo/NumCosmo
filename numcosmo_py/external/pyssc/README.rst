==================
Welcome to PySSC!
==================

| **PySSC** is a Python implementation of the fast Sij approach to Super-Sample Covariance (SSC).
| It allows to easily compute the SSC part of the covariance for most cosmological observables.
|
| The original full-sky implementation was developed by `Lacasa & Grain 2018 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...624A..61L/exportcitation>`_ (`arXiv:1809.05437 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05437>`_).
| The partial sky implementation was presented in `Gouyou Beauchamps et al. <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210902308G/exportcitation>`_ (`arXiv:2109.02308 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02308>`_).
